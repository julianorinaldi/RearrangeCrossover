# RearrangeCrossover
Test for position: C# (.NET) Software Engineer

Consider an array of n decimal integers named elements. We want to rearrange elements according to the following rules:

Sort the integers in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representations. For example, 710 → 1112 and 810 → 10002, so 8 (which has single 1 in binary) would be ordered before 7 (which has triple 1's in binary).
Two or more integers having the same number of 1's in their binary representations are ordered by increasing decimal value. For example, 510 → 1012 and 610 → 1102 both contain double 1's in their binary representation, so 5 would be ordered before 6 because it has the smaller decimal value.
Complete the rearrange function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array of n integers, elements. The function must sort the elements array according to the rules above and return the sorted array.

Input Format:
The internal test cases read the following input from stdin and passes it to the function:

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of integers in elements.

Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains an integer describing elementsi.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ elementsi ≤ 109
Output Format:
Return an array of n integers denoting the sorted elements.

Explanation (0):
Given elements = [1, 2, 3]:

110 → 12
210 → 102
310 → 112
The decimal integers 1 and 2 both have single 1 in their binary representation, so we order them by increasing decimal value (i.e., 1 < 2). The decimal integer 3 has double 1's in its binary representation, so we order it after 1 and 2. We then return elements = [1, 2, 3] as our sorted array.

Sample Input (1):
5

7

Sample Output (1):

14
Explanation (1):
Given elements = [5, 3, 7, 10, 14]:

510 → 1012
310 → 112
710 → 1112
1010 → 10102
1410 → 11102
The decimal integers 5, 3, and 10 have double 1's in their binary representations, so we order them by increasing decimal value (i.e., 3 < 5 < 10). The decimal integers 7 and 14 have tripe 1's in their binary representations, so we place them after 3, 5, and 10 in increasing decimal order (i.e., 7 < 14). We then return elements = [3, 5, 10, 7, 14] as our sorted array.

For example:

Input		Result
3		|		1
1		|		2
2		|		3
